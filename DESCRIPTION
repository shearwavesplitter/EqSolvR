Description: Package for solving chemical equilibria for a given set of reactants and products. The motivation for this program was to enable the calculation of pH and speciation given a simple mix of salts. Normally temperatures range between 300°C and 400°C at 0.5 kb. This package has been writting in such a manner that an advanced user can easily set their own reactants, products and temperature in the generic version (chemsolve_generic). chemsolve_generic is the workhorse for chemsolve. Equations are solved numerically using the multiroot function from rootSolve package.
